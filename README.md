# My Ghibli Clock App

The Ghibli Clock is a clock app inspired by Studio Ghibli movies involving a slideshow of Studio Ghibli movies gifs and a music medley button that the user can
click on to play a few selections from Studio Ghibli movie soundtracks.

This app was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Planning and Execution

The original plan was to have gifs and matching music change for every hour (day with day music and same with night time).

## Future Additions

- Have gifs and music match and play for each hour
- Add stop button for users to stop playing music
- Add feature so when user refreshes page the same song is available for them to play
- Add restart button so user won't have to refresh page to play songs over

## Tools Used:
